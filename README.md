# Overview
This is the repo for the main API for robot social. Eventually, this will be just a pass-through service, but for now it is a REST API. Once I implement chat features, I'll go ahead and make at least 2 more services, one being the REST stuff here, this one becoming a pass-through, and a third to handle socket-based chat.


## Commands

`yarn install` installs sets it up.
`nest start --watch` sets it up in watch mode
`yarn test` runs unit tests
